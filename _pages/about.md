I am an Assistant Professor in Mathematics at the National University of Singapore. I work in number theory, specifically in arithmetic geometry and the Langlands program. 

In Spring 2026 (AY25/26 Sem 2) I am teaching MA6201: Topics in Algebra and Number Theory. The course site is [here](../files/ma6201.html).

Previously, I was a Szego Assistant Professor in Mathematics at Stanford University from 2023-2025. I was at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn from 2022-2023. 

I received my PhD in 2022 from [Harvard University](https://www.math.harvard.edu/), where my advisor was [Mark Kisin](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~kisin/). Here is [my CV](../files/CV.pdf).

My email is sylee AT nus DOT edu DOT sg.
