I am a Szego Assistant Professor in Mathematics at [Stanford University](https://mathematics.stanford.edu/). I work in number theory, specifically in arithmetic geometry and the Langlands program. 

Previously, I was at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn from 2022-2023. 

I received my PhD in 2022 from [Harvard University](https://www.math.harvard.edu/), where my advisor was [Mark Kisin](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~kisin/). Here is [my CV](../files/CV.pdf).
