<h3>Introduction to Shimura varieties</h3>
<p>Lecture: Thursday 10am-1pm at S17-05-11</p>
<p>The aim of this course is to introduce the theory of Shimura varieties, and related topics. Key topics include: Abelian varieties and p-divisible groups, definition and classification of Shimura data, canonical models, integral models, zeta functions of Shimura varieties.</p> 

<p>Students taking the course for a grade will be required to give an in-class presentation (40%) and write a short final paper (5-10 pages, 60%) on a chosen topic. Undergraduate students interested should contact me for approval to enroll. </p>

<p> Lecture 1: (15/1): Modular curves
<br>Lecture 2: (22/1): Hodge structures, Shimura data, adelic formulation of Shimura varieties over C
